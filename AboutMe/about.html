                </u></h1>
            <p> The main purpose of this website is to give clients and recruiters a better understanding of my current skill set. The secondary purpose is to give insight into what type of person I am prior to any communication. Have you ever had those moments
                where the resume didn't match the character in the slightest bit? I'm sure we all have, this website is to prevent that from happening here.</p>

            <h1 class="Mid-Text-Controller"><u><i>Who am I?</i></u></h1>
            <p>My name is Trevor Alan Winn, I am prior AirForce and soon to be Computer science major with self taught knowledge in C++, C#, Python, Java-script, HTML, CSS. Currently my best language is C++ simply due to it being my first language I learned.</p>
            <h2 class="Mid-Text-Controller"><u><i>What am I looking for?</i></u></h2>
            <p>I am looking for a career in computer science to compliment my college courses, I don't want to just be good enough, I want to be ahead of my peers and strive further by jumping straight into the fray. I truly believe I have the ability necessary
                to be a valuable asset to any team.</p>

                    <section><b>Current programming languages I am familiar with: (but not limited to)</b> <br>C++, Python, Javascript, C#. My familiarity is also in that order. <br> C++ is the language I learned first by watching videos called Absolute Noob Spoonfeed
                        by antirtfm, I watched this when I was around 11 years old and would go back to them and other resources for the course of 7 years. Another resource that helped me greatly was the website Sololearn. <br> Python I learned by using
                        my abundant C++ knowledge and using the python documentation and w3 schools. w3 schools was very helpful as it has great example code to visually see how things should be done, I am very confident in my python thanks to these resources.
                        <br> My Javascript is proficient thanks to the coding train on Youtube and thanks to again w3 schools, most of my Javascript understanding is from coding train with w3 schools as a good refresher, the buttons on this website were
                        done using Javascript, cool right! <br> My C# is iffy simply because I don't use it nearly as often as the others, I only really used C# for unity because making games is quite enjoyable, I have since started using godot hence
                        why my C# is rusty. I used simply used my C++ and documentation to learn C#. It is pretty straightforward to transfer the knowledge over. <br> Do to learning different languages and debugging to build a understanding of what they
                        are doing beneath the hood I believe I can learn any language in a timely manner and become truly proficient within a small amount of time.</section>

                    <h1> US Airforce </h1>
                    <section> The US Airforce was actually my first job and my first pick. I wanted to go to the airforce for some simple reasons: <br> I wanted to follow in my families footsteps. My grandpa and uncles had all go into the military and it is a point
                        of pride for us. <br> I had a love for programming before the Airforce, so part of the reason for joining the Airforce was to go to college without taking out student loans. I scored well on the asvab so I managed to qualify for
                        a hardware based job which I was going to use to get me jump started on my understanding of computers. Sadly I got hurt and was sent home on medical separation.</section>
                    <h1> Ingles Markets </h1>
                    <section> Ingles was my second job, Starting out at ingles I was put in the gas station where I handled all of the paperwork related to the gas station which included all sales. (Food, Candy, Cigerettes, gas) I also took all calls related to
                        the pumps, from customer service and corporate Ingles, I worked in the gas station for about 9 months. Afterwards I moved inside the store to run the U-scan, customer service related task and office cash handling. I did this for
                        about 4 months. Finally my last job in Ingles was stocking dairy, I decided to transfer to dairy as a promotion, I stayed at dairy for about 1-2 months before I was offered a better job at a Adidas warehouse.</section>
                    <h1> Adidas Warehouse </h1>
                    <section> Adidas was a amazing job that I enjoyed greatly at first but sadly do to my prior injury at the Airforce it started to cause me so much pain that standing after work or even on my days off became impossible. I worked at Adidas for
                        around 2-3 months. </section>
